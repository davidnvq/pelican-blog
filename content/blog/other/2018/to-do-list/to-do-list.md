2. Attentional Network for Visual Object Detection

    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01478.pdf

    We proposed an attentional network for visual object detection.
    It sequentially generated glimpse regions of various
    sizes and aspect ratios, extracted features from these regions,
    and made a final decision based on the information it had
    acquired. The key advantage of the proposed method was
    that the glimpses were adaptively generated in order to make
    more accurate decision. Since there were no ground truth
    annotations for glimpse locations and shapes, we trained the
    network using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The consistent
    performance improvement over the baseline method
    verified the benefit of incorporating the attention mechanism
    to the deep neural networks for the visual object detection
    task.

3. PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO ATTENTION: IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS VIA ATTENTION TRANSFER

    https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03928.pdf

    Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience. Furthermore, it has
    recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the
    context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such
    as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining
    attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information
    in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN
    network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network.
    To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing
    consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural
    network architectures. Code and models for our experiments are available at
