2. Attentional Network for Visual Object Detection

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01478.pdf

We proposed an attentional network for visual object detection.
It sequentially generated glimpse regions of various
sizes and aspect ratios, extracted features from these regions,
and made a final decision based on the information it had
acquired. The key advantage of the proposed method was
that the glimpses were adaptively generated in order to make
more accurate decision. Since there were no ground truth
annotations for glimpse locations and shapes, we trained the
network using a reinforcement learning algorithm. The consistent
performance improvement over the baseline method
verified the benefit of incorporating the attention mechanism
to the deep neural networks for the visual object detection
task.

3. PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO ATTENTION: IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS VIA ATTENTION TRANSFER

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.03928.pdf

Attention plays a critical role in human visual experience. Furthermore, it has
recently been demonstrated that attention can also play an important role in the
context of applying artificial neural networks to a variety of tasks from fields such
as computer vision and NLP. In this work we show that, by properly defining
attention for convolutional neural networks, we can actually use this type of information
in order to significantly improve the performance of a student CNN
network by forcing it to mimic the attention maps of a powerful teacher network.
To that end, we propose several novel methods of transferring attention, showing
consistent improvement across a variety of datasets and convolutional neural
network architectures. Code and models for our experiments are available at
